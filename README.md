# Google_Places
Interesting POIs based on google places API (McDonalds, Burger King, Restaurants or what ever you want).

You can search for points of interest (POIs) based on 'google places'.
If you type the search term in quotation marks, only the names of the places are considered. Otherwise, the search term is matched against "... name, type, and address, as well as customer reviews and other third-party content."

Example: 
If you type "restaurant" - like here in quotation marks - only places which names contain "restaurant" are listed.
If you type  restaurant -  like here without quotation marks - much more places are listed: The name, type, and address, as well as customer reviews and other third-party content will be considered.

The search works worldwide.

For Germany popular search terms are: McDonald's, ALDI, LIDL, ADAC, etc.

In Italy popular search terms are: McDonald's, AGIP, Pizza, etc.

In USA  popular search terms are: Walmart, McDonald's, KFC, etc.

If you drive a Tesla electric car, you should search for "tesla supercharger" ;-)

Good luck!!!
